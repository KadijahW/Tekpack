            <p>What if I told you to make 2,000 gallons of water to make the jeans you are wearing right now, you wouldn’t believe it.
                Nobody ever really thinks what it took to make a piece of clothing we just like it and buy it. </p>

            <p>
                The big problem in the fashion world today is that textile dying is the second largest polluter of water globally and
                majority of these textiles are ended up in landfills or burned because of:

                    <li>sample exchanges between designer and factory supplier</li>
                    <li>design && specification inaccuracy</li>
                    <li>lost mail and emails</li>
                    <li>miscommunications between the two parties</li>

            Tekpack is your one stop shop to manage and keep track of all product specifications and its related content seamlessly. The whole process will cut down on waste in the supply chain and prevent costly mistakes in production. 
            We’ve created a simple user interface that helps designers troubleshoot before any fabric is cut. These can be made with real time updates and reduce human error to create a better communication flow between designer and factory. 
            A user can also upload their own design and changes, they can upload a modified sketch that will be updated instantly for all parties associated on the project. Also for designers we’ve added an template option where they can choose from one of our basic templates. Further increasing productivity when working on designs with similar specs.

                    <li>Designers to be able to send factories their url link. The supplier will have to sign up under the supplier account to
                        access the designers projects. Supplier will not be allowed to edit images or measurements but they will be able to comment 
                        on designers projects.</li>
                    <li> Designers sketches will be 3D and dynamic where once a measurement is inputed the image would display the input in real time.</li>
                    <li>Add an Export option where suppliers are able to export the spec sheet as a PDF or just the measurements as an excel 
                        sheet for printing purposes.</li>
